# rpt: a path tracer in rust

Work in progress â€” a path tracing engine written in Rust.

The library containing path tracing code is located inside `src/`. Example code and scenes are located in `examples/`. To compile the code and run `examples/basic.rs`, use the command:

```bash
cargo run --example basic
```

To run tests, use:

```bash
cargo test
```
